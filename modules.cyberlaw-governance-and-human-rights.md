## Week 1

[Week 1 and 2 PDF](/Cyberlaw%20Governance%20and%20Human%20Rights/Week%201%20and%202%20-%20Criminal%20Law%20in%20England%20and%20Wales.pdf)

# Week 1 and 2

## Sources of law

Legislation 
* Acts passed by parliament
* Absolutely binding
* Parliamentary Supremacy and highest law


Case Law 
* precedent
* judges MUST apply legislation
* judges MUST follow principles set by similar cases

## Key points of law

Legislation is the highest form of law.
If there is no one judges will create new law.
There are couple of ways how judges apply law:

* **Literal Rule**
    Judge apply the law word by word.

* **The Golden Rule**
    Judge will use "common sense".

* **The Mischief Rule**
    Judge looks at the problem the law was trying to solve and try to fix it. Focuses on solving a specific problem.

* **The Purposive Approach**
    Judge will look at the purpose of the law and apply it. Focuses on achieving the overall goals of the lawmakers.

## Terminology

**"Precedent"**: The system whereby judges follow decisions.

**“Binding”**: The decision in a previous case MUST be followed.

**“Persuasive”**: The decision in a previous case need not be 
followed, but should be taken heavily into account.

**“Follow”**: When a court makes the same decision as a 
previous court for the same reasons.

**“Distinguish”**: The court decides they do not have to follow a 
previous case because the facts were different. This does not 
replace the old precedent.

**“Overrule”/“Overturn"**: When a court with the power to do so 
decides a previous ruling should not be followed, even 
though the facts are similar. This replaces the old precedent.
Reverse: If the SAME case is appealed to a higher court, the 
higher court may make a different decision so as to replace 
the original decision entirely.

## How to read law?  
s19(1)(b)(iii)  
section 19 > subsection 1 > paragraph b > subparagraph iii

## Criminal Law

Then law is broken we take into consideration:
* conduct
* mindset
* outcome

Burden of proof in most cases on the prosecutor. In criminal cases beyond reasonable doubt(fluid term).

## Criminal Liability occurs when:
 
* **Actus Reus** - "Guilty act",conduct/physical element of a crime,ome crimes require both an action AND a result from that action (murder), others don't require result (rape). It must be voluntary.  
Omission - failure to act. Generally there is not duty to act but If there exists a specific duty to act – then omission should be punishable.

* **Mens Rea** -"guilty mind", Mental elements when committing a crime/not always required
motive does NOT matter, intention does
Level of seriousness:  
Intention > Recklessness > Negligence > Blameless Inadvertence

* Causation (not required in 100% of cases), "BUT FOR" test, chain of causation,"The harm would not have occurred BUT FOR the action of the defendant."  
Breaking the "chain of causation": actions such as intervening Act of a third party, "act of god", actions on victim, Eggshell Skull Rule- Unusual weakness on part of victim DOES NOT break the chain.

* Absence of a Criminal defense (Lack of legal defense regarding the offense)  
Capacity Defenses defenses (burden of proof on the defendant): age, insanity, diminished responsibility, automatism  
Circumstance Defense: self defense, duress, necessity, loss of control, mistake
